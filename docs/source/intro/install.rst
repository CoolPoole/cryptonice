Executable
^^^^^^^^^^
We will soon be releasing executables for Windows, with Mac and \*nix soon to follow. Until then,
please use the Python distributables.

Python 3
^^^^^^^^
You should have `Python 3.7`_ (or later) and the Python installer `PIP`_ already installed. Using
PIP simply install Cryptonice by entering the following command::

    pip install cryptonice



.. _Python 3.7: https://www.python.org/downloads/
