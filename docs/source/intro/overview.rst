Why Use Cryptonice?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are many tools available for scanning and analysing the results of TLS and HTTPS configurations. In fact, many of them are web based and do not need to be downloaded. So why use Cryptonice over these services? Cryptonice is aimed at solving these sorts of problems:

* A security team wants to view scans of multiple websites without having to submit and wait for individual requests to web-based services.
* A developer wants to scan an internal test site that is not publicly accessible.
*  An internal auditor wants a complete picture of HTTPS deployment, not just TLS and certification details.*  A developer team lead wants to produce detailed analysis with recommended practices for improving the TLS configuration.
*  DevOps engineers want to integrate HTTPS checking into a development pipeline so that APIs can test HTTPS configurations, with results automatically fed back into the loop.
